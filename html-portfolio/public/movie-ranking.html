<h3>Lost in Translation (2003)</h3>
<p>I love those movies where you need to pay attention, because there's not a lot of loud music.. The dialogue here is great, the vibes are just right. </p>

<h3>Ordinary People (1980)</h3>
<p>Powerful movie. Stellar acting. From the times where a movie had to be THAT good to get an Oscar.</p>

<h3>Dead Ringers (1988)</h3>
<p>Another classic. The soundtrack is misleading in the best possible way. A haunting movie that will stick with you.</p>
